						<h2>The Big Picture</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>After a schism in an online forum dedicated to snarking on Christian fundamentalists, r/FundieSnark, participants founded a new forum explicitly grounded in storytelling: r/FundieSnarkUncensored.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							In the summer of 2020, an online group formed to snark on fundamentalist Christians reached a breaking point. The snark in r/FundieSnark, some thought, had gone too far. Rather than pointed humor at the expense of fundamentalists’ oppressive beliefs, the subreddit had begun replicating those very beliefs, namely misogyny expressed through vitriolic commentary on fundamentalist women’s postpartum bodies, physical beauty, and lack of sexual agency. This decline into targeted hate was spurred in part by draconian moderation policies that penalized users who offered context or personal stories of their own experiences with fundamentalist beliefs. In response, the subreddit fractured. A significant number of snarkers formed a new subreddit, r/FundieSnarkUncensored, that explicitly invited storytelling as a means to remediate structural, content-based, and discursively-embedded misogyny.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In my dissertation research, I used participant-observation, semi-structured interviews, and computational topic modeling to study r/FundieSnarkUncensored's first year.</p>
						<p>I argue that their new rhetorical practices <span strong emphasis style="color: #fdf6e3;">renegotiate snarker identity boundaries</span> and <span strong emphasis style="color: #fdf6e3;">break down us-vs-them polarization</span>, allowing for a more fruitful community response to embedded misogyny and making potential cultural-political action possible.</p>

					<h3>Before we can talk about storytelling in r/FundieSnarkUncensored, we need to introduce some key concepts!</h3>

					<h2>"Fundie?"</h2>

					<section>
						<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/pv-target-images/93c9f8583d697a469bc1e3f42faa7230641ec4bd1e7c817433d739686e4dbef0.jpg" alt="A promotional photo for the TLC series 19 Kids and Counting depicting Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar in front of their children.">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a promotional image for the TLC reality TV show 19 Kids and Counting, which followed Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar as they raised their large family as Independent Fundamental Baptists. The TV show capitalized on people's voyeuristic interest in "fringe" lifestyles, although the Duggar family explicitly welcomed the show as an outreach opportunity, and, like many other reality shows, quickly accrued a snark community.

						<h2>"Snark?"</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Snark is a form of humorous mockery that is intrinsically distancing and ethically complicated.</h3>
						<p>Because snark creates or amplifies distance, it invokes a sense of superiority and can be used to dehumanize others.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>However, it doesn't always "punch down."</h3>
						<p>Snark can also be used to undercut or delegitimize arguments made in bad faith, from false premises, or otherwise not worth validating through serious engagement.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							For example, a recent video from Fox News demonstrates how a woman in Seattle used snark to delegitimize a bad-faith reporter by mocking his false premises on-camera.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Recently, participants in the fundie-snarking forums have attempted to use snark to delegitimize and counter harmful ideologies.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>"Uncensored?"</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The snark in r/FundieSnark became increasingly vitriolic due to three factors:</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>The moderators censured participants for being "off topic" (telling stories) or "leg humping" (not being snarky enough)</li>
								<li>Reddit's main sorting algorithm is logarithmic, and posts require exponential engagement to stay at the top</li>
								<li>Reddit is pseudonymous, so participant identity continuity depends on patterns of behavior</li>
							</ol>
						<h6>As a result, r/FundieSnark became extremely misogynist itself.</h6>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The "Uncensored" is a snarky reference to the moderators of r/FundieSnark, not an invitation to no-holds-barred snark.</h2>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>All of this brings us back to storytelling</h2>
					<p>I'd like to discuss r/FundieSnarkUncensored's storytelling practices in relation to four main themes that emerged during the community's first year:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Storytelling as foundation</li>
						<li>Gendered power dynamics</li>
						<li>Sexual and reproductive autonomy</li>
						<li>Responses to abuse and trauma</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Storytelling as foundation</h3>
					<p>The founding members of r/FundieSnarkUncensored embraced storytelling as a means to restore connections between snarkers.</p>
					<p>Inadvertantly, they also began reshaping the snarker - snarkee dynamic.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Early participants in r/FundieSnarkUncensored were concerned about the potential that their new subreddit would mimic the snark practices of the old subreddit that had driven them away in the first place, such as bodyshaming or “mean things [that] are said just for edginess.” Much of the conversation centers on questions of empathy, with some users writing that the point of fundie-snarking seems to have shifted to villainizing or outright mischaracterizing fundamentalists to the point that their humanity is forgotten. By preventing snarkers from showing concern or compassion including the sharing of relevant personal stories, thread participants write, r/FundieSnark consistently pushes the dialogue towards targeted hate, including what some users perceive to be endorsements of abuse when a fundamentalist woman “warrants” it.

					<h5>Embracing storytelling allowed snarkers to productively engage disagreement and discuss multiple potential perspectives on problematic relationship dynamics displayed in fundamentalists’ social media posts.</h5>

					<h3>Gendered Power Dynamics</h3>
						<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fundamentalists/images/4/48/OlligesWedding.jpg" height="500" alt="A wedding photo of Paul and Morgan Olliges. They look smug.">
						<aside class="notes">
							To explore these rhetorical negotiations further, I turn to a February post discussing the wedding of fundamentalist couple Paul and Morgan Olliges. The r/FundieSnarkUncensored post includes a copy of a video from the Olliges’ wedding posted by Paul and Morgan to their YouTube channel. In the video, the couple is exchanging their wedding vows when Morgan experiences a bout of nausea, vomits, and runs off the altar. Paul appears to be annoyed by this interruption to his vows and does not comfort or follow Morgan. Morgan returns after a brief interlude, and the ceremony resumes without further disruption. In their YouTube videos, the Olliges present this event as a humorous moment, but snarkers characterize the video as “genuinely quite shocking,” “[i]ncredibly sad,” and “distressing to watch.” In addition to expressing shock and distress that the couple would post the video, snarkers focus on describing the “red flags” identified in Paul’s expressions, then connecting patterns in the couple’s on-screen interactions in this and subsequent videos. These responses are a mix of observation, speculation, and interpolations of snarkers’ own experiences in abusive relationships. In replies to the top-rated comment, snarkers note that Paul’s vows, which were disrupted by Morgan’s nausea, focused on his own desires and benefits in the relationship rather than addressing Morgan as a person, and that, further, he does not comfort or assist Morgan in any way when she becomes unwell. As a result, comments characterize him as appearing “pissed that she ruined his narcissistic vows” and exhibiting body language that “screamed annoyance.” What snark exists in the replies to this post targets Paul’s response to Morgan, not Morgan’s illness or decision to enter the marriage anyways. Instead, throughout following comment threads, snarkers reflect on their own aversion to vomit, then discuss how they have responded to similar situations in their own relationships. These stories diverge along two lines. Some snarkers share how they or their partners have responded with care to gross bodily functions, even while experiencing strong negative reactions. Many of these responses express incredulity that Morgan went through with the marriage, including sentiments like “I can’t imagine marrying somebody who looked at me being sick like ‘okay well good luck with that.’” In counter, however, other commenters speculate that Morgan’s wedding-vow illness was a manifestation of a gut feeling about the dynamics of the marriage she was entering, but that she may have felt unable to call off the wedding. In these comments, snarkers identify vulnerabilities they shared with Morgan that led them to commit to marriages that they regretted: fear of a controlling partner, worries about disappointing family members, pregnancy and societal expectations. Frequently, these commenters also share the physiological reactions to stress--hives, temporary loss of vision, nightmares, nausea--that they wished they had heeded as warnings before entering their abusive marriages. Some commenters share that, perhaps similar to Morgan, they internalized these bodily responses as a failure on their part, questioning whether they were overreacting to their partners behaviors. By incorporating visceral reactions and personal stories in their comments on this video, snarkers create room for an expansive dialogue on the patriarchal pressures that force women, like Morgan, into ill-fated marriages and advocate for greater autonomy and respect for those intuitions about unbalanced power dynamics. These conversations extend beyond this post and intersect significantly with the following two themes: sexual and reproductive autonomy, and responses to abuse and trauma.

					<section>
						<h3>Sexual and Reproductive Autonomy</h3>
						<blockquote>
							&ldquo;Since there are a lot of us former fundie-lites on this page I was curious what personal experiences other people had with purity culture. Some of the fundies lurk here and maybe it could help provide some insight to others who weren’t raised in purity culture on why we snark and criticize Christianity and purity culture.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							At first glance, it would appear that very little snark happens within this theme. Most topics are serious in tone and express anger, concern, and sometimes shame about the dehumanizing treatment of women. These are heavy issues, and ones that resonate with the experiences and fears of many U.S.-based snarkers. Discussions of abortion access, the right to refuse sex within a marriage, and refusals of shame-based purity teachings draw heavily upon snarkers' own lives, which may contribute to their serious treatment. 
							This theme is perhaps best encapsulated by a pair of posts discussing the effects of purity culture on formerly-fundamentalist, fundamentalist-adjacent, and non-fundamentalist snarkers. The first post asks snarkers “How has purity culture harmed you?” The writer contextualizes this question within the parameters of a snark subreddit by sharing:
							Since there are a lot of us former fundie-lites on this page I was curious what personal experiences other people had with purity culture. Some of the fundies lurk here and maybe it could help provide some insight to others who weren’t raised in purity culture on why we snark and criticize Christianity and purity culture.
							In the text of the original post and subsequent replies, snarkers share their stories of inadequate or inaccurate sex education resulting in shame over their sexuality, vulnerability to abuse, development of vaginismus and other painful responses to sex, and disrupted relationships. Many of these replies developed into lengthy, conversational comment threads, particularly around topics about which snarkers expressed guilt or shame. Top-level comments initiate threads about consensual non-consent fantasies as a means to side-step the shame about experiencing desire, about feeling unprepared to engage in “permitted” sexual activity once married, and about self-harm and eating disorders developed in response to loss of autonomy. One commenter sums up the general descriptions of purity culture, writing:
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<section>
							<h3>Sexual and Reproductive Autonomy</h3>
							<blockquote>
								&ldquo;Purity culture taught me that my body wasn’t my own. It belonged to the men who had authority over me and any expression of sexuality beyond a chaste kiss was a sin. I was taught that the only thing worse than sexual sin (sex outside of marriage, “homosexual relations,” viewing or reading pornography, etc) was murder. Literally. That is literally something that I was told on multiple occasions.&rdquo;
							</blockquote>
							<aside class="notes">
								Purity culture taught me that my body wasn’t my own. It belonged to the men who had authority over me and any expression of sexuality beyond a chaste kiss was a sin. I was taught that the only thing worse than sexual sin (sex outside of marriage, “homosexual relations,” viewing or reading pornography, etc) was murder. Literally. That is literally something that I was told on multiple occasions.
								This emphasis on purity culture as a means to control primarily women’s sexuality echos themes from an earlier post, created several months prior, that contains more cross-cultural comparisons between fundamentalist and non-fundamentalist approaches to sexual autonomy. Snarkers who grew up in fundamentalist or high-control Christian denomination shared similar stories about the extensive control and loss of autonomy they experienced as a result of purity culture, while snarkers from more liberal Christian denominations or non-religious but culturally Christian backgrounds traced the subtler but far-ranging effects even in their own lives. While these conversations are not directly related to any particular fundamentalist and are primarily comprised of snarkers’ shared stories, these posts and responses provide a foundational knowledge of the ways fundamentalist beliefs and practices shape not only the behavior of the fundamentalists snarked upon in other posts, but the experiences snarkers may not have realized they shared with fundamentalist women.
								There are, however, experiences that are not widely shared and in which the tone of conversation differs. Discussions of specific reproductive practices--like eschewal of birth control, unassisted home births, and a desire to have many children in order to further one's religion--have prompted heated debate. Questions of sexual and reproductive agency become more complicated when the enactment of that agency conflicts with shared social values. Overall, the topics within this theme interweave personal narratives with analyses of purity culture, patriarchal theology, and vulnerability in the lives of fundamentalist women and children, creating a close connection between not only the discussions of gender and power evidenced in the previous theme, but to discussions of explicit abuse and healing from trauma that make up the next theme.

						<h3>Responses to Abuse and Trauma</h3>
						<p>Content warning: I don't include graphic descriptions from the subreddit, but this content may still be distressing.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							This theme encompasses discussion of physical or sexual abuse, child neglect, trauma, and healing. These discussions run throughout r/FundieSnarkUncensored's first year and can be characterized by concern for women made vulnerable by early marriage and pregnancy, concern and anger about suspected child neglect or abusive parenting techniques, and shock, anger, and grief over a high-profile sex crimes case involving a prominent fundamentalist. In the latter months of the year, topics within this theme pivot towards education and healing as snarkers discuss the kinds of support victim-survivors of fundamentalist abuse will need to move forward with their lives. When discussing abuse or trauma involving adults, snarkers frequently employ storytelling as a method to aid their analyses of gender and bodily autonomy and express empathy towards the victim-survivors. Situations involving children are more frequently characterized by anger, as snarkers express anger at parents for abusing or failing to protect their children and question why the state has not intervened through Child Protective Services. 
							Further, these situations involving children involve a mix of different kinds of storytelling. Responses to abusive situations involving adults, such as cases of marital rape or controlling relationships, prompt snarkers to share their own experiences or experiences of loved ones in similar situations. Fundamentalist posts containing dynamics of child abuse or neglect also elicit stories of similar experiences, usually from snarkers own childhoods, in which commenters use their religious or secular upbringings to examine the facets of abusive homes, in addition to a sort of fantastical storytelling in which snarkers step into the role of caring mother, a foil to fundamentalists mothers who are construed as unable or unwilling to love their children. In these stories, snarkers write about their daydreams of being able to take specific children home and care for them, ironically envisioning themselves fulfilling the very expectations of fundamentalist womanhood that they critique in other posts as “keepers at home.” These posts and comments contain a mix of grief and anger, both for current victim-survivors within fundamentalist families and for snarkers themselves. Towards the end of the year, topics in this theme begin to turn towards the family dynamics that enable abuse to continue, indicating that, similar to other themes, snark conversations about abuse, neglect, and trauma are expanding into a more reflexive tone as r/FundieSnarkUncensored participants begin to use snark on specific fundamentalists as quasi-case studies for larger systemic problems.

						<h3>Responses to Abuse and Trauma: Josh & Anna Duggar</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							To exemplify the interrelated conversations held within the themes of sexual and reproductive autonomy and responses to abuse and trauma, both of which in turn are closely related to gender, power, and relationships, I turn to a series of posts I turn to a series of posts responding to issues of wifely submission, childhood vulnerability, and victimization versus complicity in the case of Josh and Anna Duggar, following Josh Duggar’s indictment and subsequent conviction for possession of childhood sexual abuse materials. Please note that these posts and comments referenced in this section do not contain explicit details of the case, but they may nevertheless be distressing. 
							As noted previously, the Duggar family of Tontitown, Arkansas, was many snarkers’ introduction to Christian fundamentalism through their TLC shows 19 Kids and Counting (2008-2015) and Counting On (2015-2020). 19 Kids and Counting followed parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar as they raised an increasingly large family and focused on household management, parenting strategies, and the family’s religious beliefs. The show was canceled in 2015 after eldest son, Josh Duggar, admitted to a series of sexual offenses, including a high-profile cheating scandal and previous molestations committed when he was a teenager. TLC then launched Counting On, which focused on the eldest Duggar children and their own new families, including Josh, his wife Anna, and their seven young children. This spinoff show was likewise canceled after Josh Duggar was indicted on charges of receiving and possessing child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) in April 2021. Because the Duggar family occupies a high-profile niche in US media depictions of Christian fundamentalism, this indictment prompted waves of responses across the fundie-snarking community, including r/FundieSnarkUncensored.

						<h3>Responses to Abuse and Trauma: Josh & Anna Duggar</h3>
						<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tI7jYqSAL._SY445_SX342_.jpg" alt="The book cover for Created to Be His Helpmeet depicts a woman with long hair, a loose scarf and top, and long skirt walking through a field.">
						<aside class="notes">
							While the initial responses to the news were perhaps best characterized as shock, these were quickly followed by outrage, anger, and at times, speculation about the extent of Josh’s crimes, given his history of hands-on offenses and access to many young children within his immediate and extended family. The salaciousness of a CSAM case attracted a spike in new subreddit members from r/DuggarsSnark and true-crime subreddits, and r/FundieSnarkUncensored moderators were quick to curtail posts speculating about the potential abuse Josh might have perpetrated on his own children, since no evidence suggested he had done so. As a result, discussions began to pivot around his wife, Anna Duggar, and her potential victimhood, complicity, and responsibility to her children. Responses were split. In a post made just after the indictment, as details of the situation were still emerging, a snarker urged the subreddit to “stop shitting on Anna Duggar.” The post contends that although some Redditors have snarked on Anna or berated her for marrying Josh Duggar, quoting snarkers as saying “she’s so dumb for having more kids with him,” “she could have just left when she had the chance!,” or “she’s so stupid and she’s definitely complicit,” the reality of the situation is more complicated. The writer references well-known fundamentalist texts like Michael and Debbi Pearl’s Created to be His Help Meet that instruct wives to obey their husbands in all things. Particularly, the writer notes, these texts instruct wives to accept their own abuse unflinchingly, and to report husbands to the police only in cases of child sexual abuse. However, in such a case, wives are commanded to stay with their husbands, to visit them in jail, and to welcome them home upon release. The writer additionally points out that even if Anna could defy these cultural expectations--which, importantly, link her subservience to her husband to her subservience to God and thus to her eternal salvation--she has very few material resources available to her, should she try to leave the marriage.

						<h3>Responses to Abuse and Trauma: Josh & Anna Duggar</h3>
						<blockquote>
							&ldquo;If she stands by him now, I cannot find any sympathy left for her. Yes, she has been brainwashed, and I absolutely believe JB/Meech manipulated the hell out of her to get her to stay the first time. With that said, there is no more denying that her children would be in danger if left alone with their father. The M kids need to come first and I am much more concerned about them. At this point, she is enacting the exact same harm upon seven innocent lives as her parents and in-laws have done to her if she chooses to stay with him.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							Responses to this post were mixed. Many commenters expressed some sympathy with the original poster’s argument framing Anna primarily as another victim of Josh Duggar, specifically, and extreme patriarchy, more generally, but also pushed back on the potential elision of her responsibility to her children. In contrast to the earlier posts discussing purity culture, there is a palpable undertone of anger towards Anna Duggar despite her entanglement with the very same systems of repression, shame, and exploitation that snarkers previously discussed with grief and care. Most comments disagreeing with the original poster position Anna’s responsibility as a mother paramount to her experiences as an abused woman. One such commenter writes:
							If she stands by him now, I cannot find any sympathy left for her.

						<h3>Responses to Abuse and Trauma: Josh & Anna Duggar</h3>
						<blockquote>
							&ldquo;I disagree. You can have some empathy and acknowledgement for her circumstances, but at the end of the day she needs to protect her children first and foremost and I will blame her for that.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							Further comments likewise express limited sympathy for Anna based on her perceived failure to protect her children:
							I disagree. You can have some empathy and acknowledgement for her circumstances, but at the end of the day she needs to protect her children first and foremost and I will blame her for that.
							Within a few days, this conditional empathy for Anna and mix of anger and concern for her children became the dominant sentiment in Duggar-related posts. In a post titled “The Anna Question: A New Theory” created one week after the previous post, the author speculates about the role of fundamentalist patriarchy to present a theory about why Anna might choose to stay with her husband despite the severity of his at-that-time alleged crimes. While the comments on the previous post centered on Anna’s obligation to her children, backed by snarkers’ experiences as children in homes where they were abused and yet an adult chose not to intervene, the comments on this post begin to shift back toward the societal analysis enabled in the discussion of Paul and Morgan Olliges’ wedding video and in the paired posts about purity culture. Commenters note that Anna may not have received the same information available to the public, since the Duggar family downplayed Josh’s previous sex offenses to her before they were married, and that blaming women for failing to leave their abusers does not account for the danger they face in doing so.

							By the end of the second week post-indictment, discourse within r/FundieSnarkUncensored had swung from entirely blaming Anna for not protecting her children, to absolving her of any culpability for abuse that might have happened in the home, to an uneasy grappling with the inadequacy of a victim:abuser binary. In the comments on a post that both agreed “Anna is a brainwashed victim” and also “just as bad as sexpest” if she would not leave her husband, writers struggled between acknowledging Anna’s choices, constrained as they were, to both marry and then remain with Josh and a growing uneasiness with the number of posts speculating on her complicity compared to the relatively few posts about how the Duggar family and their local community protected and enabled Josh. In a downthread exchange, one commenter points out the potential deflection happening when snarkers focus on Anna rather than Josh.
							In these posts and comments from the early days of the Duggar indictment and trial, Anna Duggar stands in as a figure through which snarkers negotiate their previously-expressed values around gendered power dynamics, bodily autonomy, and women’s role within the family. While previous topics, such as the Olliges’ wedding and purity culture, elicited primarily empathetic responses grounded in snarkers’ own experiences with similar situations or expectations, the Duggar case touched a nerve and exposed conflict in r/FundieSnarkUncensored’s discursive values. These tensions demonstrate that although storytelling does function to counter the intensification factors identified in the previous chapter in favor of more relational interactions, these storytelling practices are differentiated and at times limited by snarkers’ position vis-a-vis the subject-objects of their snark.

					<h5>Rhetorical empathy, parasociality, and reflexivity</h5>

					<h5>Rhetorical empathy, parasociality, and reflexivity</h5>
					<p>Blankenship describes the project of rhetorical empathy as <q>“coming alongside or feeling with the experiences of an Other rather than feeling for or displacing an Other, which is usually associated with pity or sympathy”</q> (2019, p. 7-8).</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Across themes, from meta conversations to actual snarking, participants in r/FundieSnarkUncensored build a dense web of interrelationships that can be characterized through what Lisa Blankenship names “rhetorical empathy.” Building from Krista Ratcliffe’s concept of “rhetorical listening,” Blankenship continues the  feminist extension of rhetoric beyond agonistic models centered on persuading or “winning over” others to recenter rhetoric as a process of mutual understanding, compromise, and reflexive change. In this context, Blankenship describes the project of rhetorical empathy as “coming alongside or feeling with the experiences of an Other rather than feeling for or displacing an Other, which is usually associated with pity or sympathy.” To do so, she traces four feminist rhetorical strategies that underpin rhetorical empathy: “[y]ielding to an Other by sharing and listening to personal stories, [c]onsidering motives behind speech acts and actions, [e]ngaging in reflection and self-critique, [and] [a]ddressing difference, power, and embodiment.” 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h5>Rhetorical empathy, parasociality, and reflexivity</h5>
					<aside class="notes">
						The first strategy, sharing and listening to personal stories, is quite clearly present in r/FundieSnarkUncensored’s discourse. From the early vent posts with their strings of stories in the comments to later, more obviously “snark” posts directly commenting on fundamentalist media, r/FundieSnarkUncensored is ripe with stories. The more interesting questions become whether, and to what extent, these storytellers engage in the following strategies of considering motives, engaging in self-reflection and critique, and addressing differences in power and embodiment that might shape their storytelling engagement. Some of these strategies must be necessarily modified in the context of snarking. While Blankenship’s theory of rhetorical empathy relies primarily on examples of two-way communication, such as a gay evangelical’s open letter to his community and their subsequent replies, snark is exclusively unidirectional. Due to both the platform’s terms of service and ethical norms around snarking, snarkers do not, or should not, contact the fundamentalists about whom they snark. By necessity, this relationship between snarkers and snarkees is parasocial, a one-sided relationship sustained in some way by imagination and mediated encounters. Although snarkers do base the majority of their snark in personal media shared by fundamentalists, such as Facebook or Instagram posts, snarkers both only see what fundamentalists choose to post, which is likely not representative of their full lives, and rely on interpretations of those posts, since they cannot engage in dialogue or ask for clarification. As a result, the element of “considering motives,” in particular, becomes sticky, as seen in the distorted stories told in response to real or perceived child abuse or neglect.

						To balance this question of “considering motives” and parasociality, snarkers must pay particular attention to the final two elements of rhetorical empathy: self-reflection and critique, and attention to difference. As cultural theorist Sara Ahmed writes, emotions, including empathy, are a form of cultural politics: as emotions “stick,” accrue, or circulate among/through/around people and bodies of people, these objects of emotion become “sites of personal and social tension.” Accordingly, emotions become forms of orientation towards the Other, and these individual orientations are mediated through larger cultural emotions surrounding the idealized subject: in this case, citizen, woman, mother. While snarkers may not consider themselves to be engaging in rhetorical empathy or in a cultural politics of emotion, these frameworks can still be seen within the discursive trends of r/FundieSnarkUncensored. Although snarkers use storytelling ostensibly as a way to better understand the fundamentalists--as evidenced by early concerns about (de)humanization of fundamentalists in r/FundieSnark--the true use of storytelling in this community may actually be closer to self-reflection. That is, by telling personal stories in the down-thread comments of posts snarking on fundamentalist media, participants are reshaping the overarching narratives about fundamentalists but also reconstructing their (again, parasocial) relationship to those fundamentalists in ways that foster intracommunity relationality. When snarkers share stories about difficult pregnancies or navigating controlling romantic relationships in their own lives, for example, they begin to interact with Blankenship’s idea of self-reflection and critique as well as a feminist or proto-feminist politicization of pain. These personal stories are not about fundamentalists or fundamentalism, per se, but they position the experiences of snarkers and snarkees in the same context of misogynist social structures, allowing snarkers to potentially use their storytelling to understand themselves as part of a class of persons whose bodies are disproportionately controlled. In these storytelling instances, rhetorical empathy elucidates the accrual of cultural emotions and values onto specific classes of reproductive bodies, allowing snarkers to productively redefine their relationship to fundamentalist women and to other snarkers while maintaining a “snark” identity.
